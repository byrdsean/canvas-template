# Canvas Template
A boilerplate setup for creating a HTML canvas project. This project:
1. Limits the frame refreshes to 60 FPS (frames per second)
2. Adds basic keyboard controls when pressing the up, down, left and right keyboard buttons.
3. Contains a static class to get the 2D canvas context so that any object can draw to the canvas.

## Code entry point
The `animate.ts` file creates a new instance of the `CanvasProject` class, then continuously calls the method to render the frames from this class.

## Dependencies
This project uses typescript to transpile TS code to Javascript (JS) code: https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
